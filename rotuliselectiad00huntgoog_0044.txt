He had thrown his influence into the scale of the King. But
now that the contest might be said to have subsided, sofar
as it respected any great constitutional or political question,
and was a contest of vengeance on the one hand, and despair
on the other, the Pope became the advocate of peace and
mercy3 and it was chiefly through the mediation of the
Legate Ottobone, that the King consented to the adoption
of lenient measures, and to rescind the determination which
had stripped at once oi all their revenues the persons of
higher or lower dignity who hadbeen, in any portion of the
contest so long carried on, arrayed against him.

It seems to be ren undetermined by the Chroniclers of the
time under what species of authority it was that the Twelve
Mediators agreed upon the terms between the King and the
Barons, which are embodied in what is called the Dictum de
Kenilworth. The words in which the writer of the Annals

of Waverley speaks of the traruaction are these z-Item ad
instantiam Legati Dominus Rex submisit se et suos dicto

quatuor Episcoporum, quatuor Comitum, quatuor Beronum,
ut ipsi duodecim pacem et tranquillitatem Regni Angliae
reformarent. There is no mention of any representatives
of the Barons having been consulted in the affair. The terms
were very moderate and reasonable as respected them3 and.
this Dictum may be regarded as at once the chief cause of

the state of intemal tranquillity which continued for so many
years, and as having done much to fix and establish certain

constitutional principles, which are in operation through the
whole period of our history to the present moment.

It would be beside the purpose of the present Pret'ace to
enter into an examination of the eflbct of all the clauses in
