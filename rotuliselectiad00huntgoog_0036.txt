'upon his lands for his own redemption; and we have another

licence granted by the King to aBaron‚ to pledge his land
to raise money to redeem himself.

Many relate to Ecclesiastical Affairs. There are thirty-one
which consist of presentations to beneficas or dignities in the
Church: another very remarkable one by which the King
assuras the person to whom it is addressed, tint having twice
nominated to a Church in his dotation, the King will not
hereaster claim the right. Several are general Letters of
Protection to the Religious Houses. The affairs of the
Abbeys of Malmesbury‚ Ramsey, and especially of Glaston
at that period in avery unsettled state, receive some illustra·
tion. We have in No. 23. an important instrument respecting
the building of the Church of Liucoln. One instance only
occurs of proceedings incident to the Assumption of the Cross
and going to the Holy Land3 it is in the caseos Robert de Reos,
who has the King’s licence to pledge his lands to raise money
for the expence of the enterprise. In No. 54. we have a
remarkable catalogue of what constituted the “ capellaria '' of
Hubert late Archbishop of Canterbury3 the articles were
brought to the King at Tewksbury‚ who asterwards gave them
to the Bishop of Winchester, of whom we have other notiees.
In otherwrits we have the terms on which the contest between
the King and the Archbishop of Dublin was composed;
and in others we perceive the state of disunion in which
the King was living with the Archbisbop of York, his
half-brother. The still more difficult affairs of the See
of Canterbury, in the seventh year of King John, almost
the only subject on which the Chroniclers of that year
have touched, receive, as might be expected, much useful
illustration.
