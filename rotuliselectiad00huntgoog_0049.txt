xxxviii PREFACR

of this Roll with strict accuracy. It is not a complete ac-
count of the lands belonging to foreigners which had been
forfeited by Henry ΙΙΙ. and John in their contests or compo-
sitions with the Kings of France3 buta kind of summary
or digest of divers grants which had been made to various
persons touching those lnnds.

The preparation of this Volume was originally committed
to a gentlenran connected with the office in which these Re·
cords are deposited, who had settled all the editorial anange-
ments, and superintended by far the largest portion of the

volume through the press before my assistance was called in.
My duty has therefore been for the most part a revision of
the text and the preparation of the present introduction. The

principle on which the original Editor proceeded was that

of making the printed work conform as nearly as common
typography‚ with a few contracts cast for the purpose, would
admit, to the writing before him. This, in most instances,

deprives the reader of the benefit of any regular system of
punctuation. Other difficulties will also occur in the reading

' of these records; but variations from the original must not

be presumed in all cases in which a different orthography
might be expected, or where a violation of a concord is
discernible.

Sub-Commissioner.
