this important Document. The portion of it with which we
are concemed is only that which relatas to the terms on which
the disherited Barons and other persons were allowed to
redeem their lands.

‘⁶ Willing to proceed according to the path of equity, by'
the consent of the Reverend Father Ottobone, Decoon Cardi-
nal of St. Adrian and Legate of the Apostolic See, and the
Noble Man H. of Almaine, having like power and authority,
We have thought it good to be provided in this wise, that
there shall be made no disherison, but redemption, that is
to wit:

First, concerning them that began the war and yet continue:

Item, they that forcibly and maliciously held Northampton
against the King:

Item, they that were taken at Kenilworth which <ame
from the sacking of Winchester, or that other-where
were against the King whom he hath not yet pardoned:

Item, they that warred at Evesham against the King:

Item, they that were at Chcsterfield against the King in
battle: .

Item, they that freely, wilfirlly, and uncompelled sent any
aid against the King or his son:

Item, the Bailiffs and Officers of the Earl of Leicester
which robbed their neighbours, and procured man-
slaughters, house-bumings, and other ¹evils to be done:

Shall pay as much as their lands be worth by the space of
Five Years.”

So far the meaning of the Clause is perfectly clear in the
Dictum itself, and in the English version of it which accom-

. panias it in the Statores, as published hythe Commission.
