·selection has been made of a few which relate to the earlier
periods of English history.

I.

Botulus Litterarum Parentium de auno regni Regis
Johauuis septimo. A.D. 1205&12062 p· 1-38· ,

This Roll is a deuehed member of the series of Patent
Rolls at the Tower, extending from theodos King John
(1201) to the end of the reign of King Edward IV. (1483.)
By what means it became separated from its companions ir
not now known. Rymer has printed from it five of the
Wriur, and refers to' it i11 his margin as being then at the
Tower. If in this he is correct, itis evident: that it ,has
been removed t'o the Chapter House at avery recent period.
